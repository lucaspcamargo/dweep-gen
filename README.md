# dweep-gen
Version of old Dweep shareware game on Sega Genesis (using SGDK)

## About

This is a SGDK port of the old shareware game Dweep.

Not much to talk about for now, still getting used to the tools and drawing assets and stuff.


Music was converted using libOPNMIDI (midi2vgm).
SFX was converted by rescomp.
Art uses LibreSprite for tilesets and sprites, and Tiled for tilemaps.

## Building

The current makefile came from the SGDK marsdev example. If using another toolchain you may have to change/replace the makefile.
Should not be different to build than any other SGDK project.
